        <h3>1. Receive Your Salary</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>At the start of each in-game month, you have to collect a <span>fixed monthly salary</span>. The amount is set and remains the same each month throughout the demo.</li>
            <img src="img/How-to-play/Salarycollect.png" alt="">

        </ul>
        <h3>2. Pay Monthly Expenses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A portion of your salary will be deducted each month to cover living expenses such as rent, utilities, and other basic costs.</li>
            <img src="img/How-to-play/payexpenses.png" alt="">

            <img src="img/How-to-play/newstab.png" alt="">

        </ul>

        </ul>
        <h3>6. Sell or Hold Your Stocks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>After stock prices have updated for the new month, you have several options:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Sell</span> : If the stock’s price has gone up, you can sell to make a profit. The higher the stock price, the greater your profit.,<br><br>You can simply understand how much points the stock price changed from previous month</li>

                <li><span>Hold </span>: If you think the stock will rise further in future months, you can choose to hold onto it.</li>
                <li><span>Sell based on News</span>: If the news predicts a downturn for a stock, you might want to sell before the price drops, even if it hasn't risen yet.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The decision is yours—manage your investments wisely to maximize your gains.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>7. Repeat the Cycle</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>After you’ve made your decision to sell, hold, or buy more stocks, continue the cycle by advancing to the next month. With each month, you’ll receive your salary, pay expenses, check the news, and decide how to invest.</li>
            <li>The goal is to grow your wealth by making smart decisions about when to buy, hold, and sell stocks based on market conditions.</li>
        </ul>
